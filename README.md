# python-chess

## Playing the game

You can start the game by running the `pychess.py` file from the command line. You will then be presented with a view of the board and the text "White to move." Moves can be performed by entering commands of the form `d2 d4`, where the first term is the coordinates of a piece you control and the second term is the coordinates of the destination tile. If the move is valid, it will execute and the turn will pass to the other player.
